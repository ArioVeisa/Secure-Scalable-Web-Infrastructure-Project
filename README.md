# 🚀 Secure & Scalable Web Infrastructure Project

### 🔧 Overview
This project simulates a **secure, scalable, and automated web infrastructure**, similar to real-world enterprise environments.  
It demonstrates the implementation of a multi-tier architecture that includes a web server, database server, monitoring system, and automation scripts.

The main goals of this project are to:
- Build a production-like environment for web hosting
- Implement security best practices and server hardening
- Automate configuration and deployment
- Enable real-time monitoring and alerting
- Support backup and disaster recovery

---

### 🧱 Architecture Overview
The infrastructure consists of **three primary layers**:

1. **Frontend Layer**
   - Nginx as a reverse proxy and load balancer  
   - SSL enabled using Let’s Encrypt (Certbot)  
   - Fail2Ban for brute-force protection  

2. **Database Layer**
   - MySQL or PostgreSQL running on a private subnet  
   - Automated daily backups to external storage (S3, NAS, or local)  
   - Restricted access (only from the web server’s private network)  

3. **Monitoring & Automation Layer**
   - Prometheus + Grafana for system monitoring  
   - Ansible for automated deployment and configuration  
   - Alert system (via Telegram/Email) for service health checks
